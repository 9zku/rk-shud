## **Heavily Inspired Lightweight Hud.**
After seeing recent sucess on [rk_chud](https://github.com/9zku/rk_chud) I've decided to make a 2nd free hud, which also provides alot of compatibility with simple styles.

## **What's different between rk-shud and rk_chud?**
While most of the backend is largely the same, a few key details distinguish the two HUDs from each other.
- **Styling:** The overall look of the two HUDs differs entirely, with each presenting a basic aesthetic.
- **Scaling:** rk_chud, didn't scale well to other resolutions well, rk-shud has been tested on 1080p and 1440p and both work! (4K is NOT tested!)
- **Inspiration:** The original HUD (rk_chud) drew inspiration from several servers, most notably New Leaf. This version takes its cues from Lakeshore Roleplay.
 
## **Supported Frameworks**
- [ESX](https://github.com/esx-framework/esx_core/tree/main/%5Bcore%5D), [QB](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-core), [QBOX](https://github.com/Qbox-project/qbx_core/tree/main), [OX](https://github.com/CommunityOx/ox_core) and Custom if you make your own bridge file.
- **Dependencies:** [ox_lib](https://github.com/CommunityOx/ox_lib)
